### Regional Disparity
- **Urban advantage**: 6.67:1 completion ratio
- **Schools per 1000 children**: 0.39 urban vs. 0.225 rural
- **Mario's area deficit**: 7,700 students uncovered (61.6%)

### Economic Impact
- **Per child loss**: $215,000 lifetime earnings
- **Village impact**: $39.8M total economic loss
- **National impact**: $2.4B annual GDP loss

### Timeline Violations
- **Procurement rush**: 12.5x faster than standard (6 vs. 75 days)
- **Rural delays**: 7 months average vs. 0 for urban

## PARTICIPANT ASSESSMENT RUBRIC

### ðŸŸ¢ EXCELLENT (A-level)
- Calculates 7+ key ratios correctly
- Identifies systematic patterns across teams
- Connects financial data to human impact
- Recognizes political correlation (0.94)
- Proposes specific accountability measures

### ðŸŸ¡ GOOD (B-level)
- Calculates 4-6 key ratios correctly
- Identifies some patterns but misses connections
- Recognizes rural-urban disparity
- Spots obvious anomalies (admin costs, etc.)
- General understanding of problems

### ðŸ”´ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (C-level or below)
- Calculates fewer than 4 key ratios
- Focuses on individual numbers, not patterns
- Misses political/nepotism connections
- Doesn't connect to human impact
- Superficial analysis

---

## COACHING INTERVENTION TRIGGERS

### When to Step In:
- Student calculates completion rate but doesn't notice urban-rural gap
- Focuses on budget underspend ($60M) without seeing misallocation
- Identifies high admin costs but misses nepotism patterns
- Calculates averages without recognizing systematic bias
- Shows good math skills but poor analytical thinking

### Guiding Questions:
- "What patterns do you see when you compare these numbers?"
- "What would you expect to see if this were well-managed?"
- "How do these financial numbers affect real children?"
- "What's the relationship between politics and outcomes?"

## ANSWER KEY - ESSENTIAL STATISTICS

| Metric | Calculation | Answer | Significance |
|--------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Overall completion rate | 26Ã·60 | 43% | Program half-failed |
| Cost per school | $440MÃ·26 | $16.92M | 3.4x market rate |
| Rural completion | 6Ã·40 | 15% | Systematic discrimination |
| Urban completion | 20Ã·20 | 100% | Perfect political alignment |
| Admin bloat | $130MÃ·$50M | 2.6x | Massive overrun |
| BuildFast rate | 8Ã·35 | 22.9% | Paid 100%, delivered 23% |
| Political correlation | Given | 0.94 | Nearly perfect correlation |
| Nepotism total | $266MÃ·$440M | 60.5% | Majority of funds |
| Mario's deficit | 7,700Ã·12,500 | 61.6% | Children uncovered |
| Procurement speed | 6Ã·75 | 12.5x | Bypassed safeguards |

## COMMON PARTICIPANT ERRORS

### Mathematical Mistakes:
- Using wrong denominators (total vs. completed schools)
- Mixing up percentages and ratios
- Incorrect rounding (accept Â±2% variance)

### Analytical Mistakes:
- Seeing high numbers as "success" without context
- Missing the rural-urban pattern
- Focusing on individual contractors vs. systematic problems
- Not connecting financial data to human outcomes

### Conceptual Mistakes:
- Thinking administrative costs are reasonable
- Missing the political correlation
- Not recognizing nepotism patterns
- Ignoring the economic impact calculations

## TIME MANAGEMENT GUIDE

### Part 1 (10 minutes): Data Organization
- Look for participants to identify 5 investigative teams
- Ensure they see rural-urban divide theme
- Check if they notice political/family connections

### Part 2 (20 minutes): Statistical Analysis
- Minimum 3 calculations required
- Focus on completion rates and cost efficiency
- Guide toward nepotism percentage calculations

### Part 3 (10 minutes): Evidence Gaps
- Should identify missing oversight mechanisms
- Look for understanding of what would strengthen case
- Check if they recognize legal/accountability needs

### Part 4 (15 minutes): Briefing Synthesis
- Expect clear problem statement
- Want to see systematic vs. individual issues
- Look for actionable recommendations

---

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

### Participants are succeeding when they:
- Calculate ratios, not just identify large numbers
- Compare actual vs. expected performance
- Identify patterns across different data sets
- Connect quantitative data to qualitative impact
- Recognize political/governance dimensions
- Propose evidence-based solutions

### Red flags that participants need help:
- Only identifying large dollar amounts
- Missing the systematic nature of problems
- Not connecting different team data
- Focusing on individual bad actors vs. systemic issues
- Unable to explain what the numbers mean for children's lives

This quick reference should help facilitators efficiently assess participant progress and provide targeted guidance during the activity.
